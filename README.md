# Tools
I will add self-made tools here

1. pw_generator.py => as the name suggests it's a password generator program with the capacity to create absolutely random passwords as per the user requirements like x number of letters, y number of symbols (symbols commonly accepted by websites), z number of digits.
   To use => download the file and run the program wherever you want

2. caesar_cipher.py => a simple caesar cipher tool that can encrypt and decrypt any piece of texts based on ROT algorithms. It will leave special characters and numbers as it is as that can mess with the expected user outcome.
   To use => download the file and run the program wherever you want
