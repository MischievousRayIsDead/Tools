# Tools
I will add self-made tools here

1. pw_generator.py => as the name suggests it's a password generator program with the capacity to create absolutely random passwords as per the user requirements like x number of letters, y number of symbols (symbols commonly accepted by websites), z number of digits.
   To use => download the file and run the program wherever you want
